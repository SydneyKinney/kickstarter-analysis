Recommendations:
1. May was the month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns
2. January, June, July, and October were the months that launched the most failed campaigns 
3. US Theater campaigns were the most successful 

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The project consisted of two technical analyses. One analysis of outcomes based on launch date and another analysis of outcomes based on goals. Pivot tables and graphing in Excel were used to visualize campaign outcomes (“successful,” “failed,” and “canceled”) based on launch date. Excel was also used to visualize the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this data analysis was the see how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The most successful campaigns were launched in May. There was a steady decrease in successful campaigns for the following four months (June, July, August, September). December had the lowest number of successful campaigns. Overall, the best time to launch a campaign was during May.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The higher success rate was attributed to the lower goal. 
75% of campaigns were successful if they had a goal of less than $1000. 
100% of campaigns that had a goal of $45,000 - $49,999 failed.
Overall, the data presents that the lower the goal, the higher the success rate for the campaigns.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some of the data for outcomes based on goals was very close. The number of successful and failed campaigns were almost equal if the goal was between $5000 - $24,999. That large range presents a challenge when interpreting the data. Moreover, the data is showing that goals of $5000 had almost a 50/50 success/fail rate as well as goals of $24,999. It would be challenging to say that lower cost campaigns (i.e., $5000) were more successful than higher cost campaigns (i.e., $24,999) because they had about the same ratio of successful/failed campaigns.

## Results
The data for the outcomes based on launch date showed that the most successful campaigns were launched in May. December had the lowest number of successful campaigns. The data for the outcomes based on goals showed that the higher success rate was attributed to the lower goal. For example, 75% of campaigns were successful if they had a goal of less than $1000. 

A limitation of the outcomes based on launch date include a variable regarding the weather or season. Are more campaigns successful in May because it is warmer and/or do more campaigns fail in December because it is colder? A limitation of the outcomes based on goals dataset is the range of the goals. If the range was smaller or larger, would it change our results? Another limitation may be regarding the pledges. How many people pledged and were there outliers? If one person pledged the entire goal number, this could skew the data for the rest of the campaigns.  

A bar graph is another graph that we could use for outcomes based on launch date. A bar graph would show the significant increase in successful campaigns launched in May compared to other months. We could also use a bar graph showing the outcomes based on goals. This would allow us to see the percentage of successful and failed campaigns directly next to each other.
